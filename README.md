Developed a full-stack web application for a Coffee Shop: Designed and implemented an interactive user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless customer interactions, allowing users to browse menus, place orders, and manage their profiles.

Built the backend using Python, Flask, and SQL: Utilized Flask to create a RESTful API for handling customer orders, and integrated SQL for managing data, including order history, inventory, and user accounts, ensuring efficient data retrieval and management.
